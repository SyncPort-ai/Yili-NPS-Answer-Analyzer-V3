# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing the NPS V3 API, a next-generation intelligent customer insight platform that transforms raw NPS data into actionable business intelligence through AI-driven multi-agent analysis.

**核心价值主张 (Core Value Proposition):**
- **为高层决策者**: 提供战略级洞察，支持产品路线图和市场策略制定
- **为一线执行团队**: 提供可执行的改进建议和具体行动计划
- **为客户经理**: 提供专业的分析能力和客户成功支持工具

**第一性原理设计思维:**
```
NPS本质 = 客户推荐意愿的量化 = f(体验价值 × 情感连接 × 信任度)
AI价值 = 洞察质量提升 × 分析成本降低 × 决策循环加速
系统总价值 = 业务影响力 × 用户采纳率 × 技术可靠性 × 成本效率
```

**乳制品行业特殊性考量:**
- 季节性波动影响：春节、夏季消费高峰期的NPS基线调整
- 食品安全信任度：安全事件对推荐意愿的非线性负面影响
- 渠道复杂性：B2B批发、B2C零售、新零售全渠道体验差异
- 区域文化差异：南北方口味偏好对满意度评价的影响模式

**AI技术前沿融合:**
- 大模型可解释性：每个洞察都能追溯到具体的数据源和推理路径
- 多模态融合：文本评论 + 图片反馈 + 语音情感的综合分析
- 联邦学习：保护客户隐私的同时实现行业基准对比
- 持续学习：基于反馈的模型自适应优化和知识图谱演进

The V3 system implements a complete value creation loop with measurable business impact: 数据收集 → 智能分析 → 洞察生成 → 决策支持 → 行动执行 → 效果验证 → 学习迭代 → 价值量化，ensuring sustainable ROI and organizational transformation.
